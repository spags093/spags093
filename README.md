### Hi there, I'm Jeff (aka Spags) ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a prior background in marketing, brand activation, and producing live events.  I'm originally from new Jersey (Jersey Shore represent!) and currently based in the Orladndo area.  After years of being on stage as a touring musician and then several more years erecting stages as a producer of live events, this lifelong data geek decided to make a full career pivot into Data Science in order to fulfill a desire to bring my creativity, endless determination, and unique background into the tech world.

After witnessing first-hand the impact that data has had in many areas of the entertainment industry, I wanted to join in on the fun and be part of the exciting, burgeoning worlds of machine learning and deep learning. With the pandemic putting much of my "old life" on hold, I enrolled in the Flatiron School to build my skills in Python, Pandas, SQL, scikit-learn, Tensorflow/Keras, data analytics & visualization and many others. I'm "deeply" (pun intended) interested in building neural networks, image recognition systems, text/speech generation, and AI systems.
